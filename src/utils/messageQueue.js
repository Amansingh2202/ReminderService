/*
üîß createChannel Function ‚Äì Setting up RabbitMQ Connection
Imports amqplib to interact with RabbitMQ.

connect(MESSAGE_BROKER_URL):

Connects to the RabbitMQ server.

Acts like calling the post office.

createChannel():

Opens a channel to send/receive messages.

Like getting a counter at the post office.

assertExchange(EXCHANGE_NAME, 'direct', false):

Declares an exchange if it doesn't exist.

'direct' type routes messages based on exact routing key.

‚ö†Ô∏è false should ideally be replaced with an options object like { durable: true }.

Wraps everything in a try...catch block to handle connection/setup errors.

üì© subscribeMessage Function ‚Äì Listening for Messages
assertQueue(QUEUE_NAME):

Declares a queue (mailbox) for incoming messages.

Ensures the queue exists.

bindQueue(queue, exchange, binding_key):

Binds the queue to the exchange using a routing key.

Ensures only messages with a matching key go into this queue.

consume(queue, callback):

Listens for messages in the queue.

When a message arrives:

Prints it to the console.

Calls channel.ack(msg) to confirm it's been processed.

Prevents the message from being re-sent.
